# Project Image Classification Model Deployment

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of fast food types into categories. The model uses a transfer learning approach with a pre-trained ResNet architecture to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the training process.

## Objective
- The model will be trained to recognise and classify the images into several fast food food classes such as burgers, pizza, fries, etc.
- Utilising pre-trained ResNet models, we can leverage existing knowledge to improve classification accuracy.
- Stores in several formats such as TFJS (TensorFlow.js), TFLite (TensorFlow Lite), and SavedModel for easy deployment to various platforms.

## Tools
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Zipfile
- Pathlib
